STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE: HYDRAULIC SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

Document ID: SOP-HYD-001
Version: 2.1
Effective Date: January 2024

1. PURPOSE
This SOP establishes the procedures for routine maintenance of hydraulic systems in the manufacturing facility.

2. SCOPE
Applies to all hydraulic equipment including presses, lifts, and conveyor systems.

3. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
- Lock Out/Tag Out (LOTO) must be performed before any maintenance
- Required PPE: Safety glasses, gloves, steel-toe boots
- Maximum operating pressure: 3000 PSI
- Emergency stop button location must be verified before work begins

4. DAILY INSPECTION CHECKLIST
4.1 Check hydraulic fluid level in reservoir
4.2 Inspect for leaks at connections and seals
4.3 Verify pressure gauge readings are within normal range
4.4 Listen for unusual pump noises
4.5 Check filter condition indicator

5. WEEKLY MAINTENANCE
5.1 Test emergency shutdown system
5.2 Clean or replace air breathers
5.3 Check accumulator pre-charge pressure
5.4 Inspect hoses for wear or damage

6. MONTHLY MAINTENANCE
6.1 Sample and analyze hydraulic fluid
6.2 Clean heat exchanger fins
6.3 Calibrate pressure relief valves
6.4 Inspect cylinder rod seals

7. TROUBLESHOOTING
7.1 Low Pressure: Check fluid level, filter, pump wear
7.2 Overheating: Inspect heat exchanger, fluid condition
7.3 Slow Operation: Check for internal leaks, worn components
7.4 Noisy Operation: Air in system, cavitation, worn bearings

8. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
In case of hydraulic leak:
- Activate emergency stop immediately
- Evacuate area if fluid is hot
- Report to supervisor
- Do not attempt repairs until system is fully depressurized
